# Junior Full-Stack Web Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my Junior Full-Stack Web Developer Portfolio! This project serves as a platform for me to showcase my professional journey as a web developer, as well as some of the exciting projects I've worked on. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and its key features.

This portfolio is already deployed and accessible at [www.alessandro-ontani.com](https://www.alessandro-ontani.com).

## Project Structure

The portfolio is organized into three distinct sections, each designed to provide visitors with valuable insights into my professional background and skills:

### Section 1: About Me

In this section, I introduce myself and provide details about my passions, hobbies, education, and the path I've followed to become a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer. Visitors can also access my resume and explore my technology stack.

### Section 2: My Projects

The "My Projects" section highlights some of my latest projects. I've chosen to showcase four projects, each represented by a card that can be clicked to reveal more information. This allows visitors to get a glimpse of my work and dive deeper into the details of each project.

### Section 3: Contact Me

In the "Contact Me" section, visitors can find links to my social accounts, such as LinkedIn and GitHub, to connect with me professionally. Additionally, there is a contact form available for direct communication.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient and dynamic rendering of content, making it a great choice for this portfolio.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the backbone of this project, providing the interactivity and functionality that brings the portfolio to life.

- **Tailwind CSS**: I opted to implement Tailwind CSS for the styling of the application. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and visually appealing designs.

- **Framer Motion**: To add engaging animations to various elements within the portfolio, I incorporated Framer Motion. This library helped me learn and apply animations effectively.
